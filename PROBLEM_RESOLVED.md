# Problem Resolution - "Invalid API key" Error

## Problem
The application was showing an "Invalid API key" error when attempting to login.

## Root Cause
The `.env` file contained mismatched Supabase credentials from two different projects:
- URL pointed to: `veutiatioxdbuxftlear.supabase.co`
- API key was for: `ozkophqoeynggfqjhcjo.supabase.co`

This mismatch caused the authentication to fail with an "Invalid API key" error.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Environment Variables
Updated `.env` file to use consistent credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="veutiatioxdbuxftlear"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://veutiatioxdbuxftlear.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

### 2. Verified Database Setup
- Confirmed all 8 required tables exist in the database
- Verified Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables
- Confirmed all security policies are properly configured

### 3. Updated Scripts and Documentation
- Updated `create-users-simple.mjs` with correct Supabase URL
- All documentation now references the correct project ID: `veutiatioxdbuxftlear`

### 4. Verified Build
- Application builds successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- Bundle size: 1.1MB (production ready)

## What's Working Now

✅ **Supabase Connection** - API key is now valid and matched to correct project
✅ **Database** - All tables and security policies properly configured
✅ **Authentication System** - Ready to accept logins
✅ **Application Build** - Compiles without errors

## What You Need to Do Next

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Create Test Users

The "Invalid API key" error is now fixed, but you still need to create user accounts to login.

**Follow these simple steps:**

1. **Get Your Service Role Key**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/veutiatioxdbuxftlear/settings/api
   - Copy the "service_role" key (NOT the anon key)

2. **Create Users**
   ```bash
   export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key-here"
   node create-users-simple.mjs
   ```

3. **Login**
   - Use these credentials:
   - Admin: `admin@clip.edu` / `ClipAdmin2024!`
   - Office: `office@clip.edu` / `ClipOffice2024!`
   - Instructor: `instructor@clip.edu` / `ClipInstructor2024!`

## Alternative: Create Users via Supabase Dashboard

If you prefer not to use the script:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/veutiatioxdbuxftlear/auth/users
2. Click "Add user" → "Create new user"
3. Create each user with email/password
4. ✅ Check "Auto Confirm User"
5. Run this SQL to assign roles:

```sql
-- Get user IDs
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users;

-- Assign roles (replace xxx-id-xxx with actual IDs from above)
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES
  ('xxx-admin-id-xxx', 'admin'),
  ('xxx-office-id-xxx', 'office');

INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role, instructor_name)
VALUES ('xxx-instructor-id-xxx', 'instructor', 'John Instructor');
```

## Verification Steps

After creating users, verify everything works:

1. **Test Login**
   - Navigate to your application
   - Login with admin@clip.edu / ClipAdmin2024!
   - Should redirect to overview page

2. **Test Database Connection**
   - After login, you should see the dashboard
   - No more "Invalid API key" errors

3. **Test Role-Based Access**
   - Admin should see "User Management" in navigation
   - Office should NOT see "User Management"
   - Instructor should see only assigned students

## Files Changed

- `.env` - Updated with correct Supabase credentials
- `create-users-simple.mjs` - Updated project URL

## Support

If you still encounter issues:
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify your dev server is running with the latest `.env` file
- Try restarting the dev server to pick up new environment variables

## Summary

The "Invalid API key" error was caused by mismatched Supabase credentials. This has been completely fixed. The application is now ready to use once you create user accounts following the steps above.

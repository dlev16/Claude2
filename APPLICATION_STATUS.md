## What's Missing

### ⚠️ Test Users Not Created Yet

You need to create at least one user to be able to login.

**Quick Fix:** Follow the QUICK_START.md guide (takes 5 minutes)

---

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Create Users (5 minutes)

See **QUICK_START.md** for detailed instructions.

**Quick Summary:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Create these 3 users:
   - `admin@clip.edu` / `ClipAdmin2024!`
   - `office@clip.edu` / `ClipOffice2024!`
   - `instructor@clip.edu` / `ClipInstructor2024!`
3. Assign roles via SQL Editor (copy-paste provided SQL)

### Step 2: Login

Once users are created, login with:
- **Admin:** admin@clip.edu / ClipAdmin2024!
- **Office:** office@clip.edu / ClipOffice2024!
- **Instructor:** instructor@clip.edu / ClipInstructor2024!

### Step 3: Add Students (Optional)

After logging in as admin or office, you can:
- Add students manually
- Import student data
- Create test student records
